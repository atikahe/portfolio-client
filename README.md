# atk-portfolio
The react front-end for my portfolio built with next.js and tailwind-css.

Now, I'm under no delusion that I can achieve this look of a page within hours without any help. Credit where credit's due. That said, I want to give my biggest thanks to [Sonny Sangha](https://www.youtube.com/c/SonnySangha) for such a compact material on how to build this portfolio. Mad respect in how he's bringing me up to speed to all these unfamiliar stacks within hours. Go support his page!

## Getting Started
